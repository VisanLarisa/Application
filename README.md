  The web application is elaborated as a solution for a car service online system, improving the efficiency of the relation between cliens and the company. It is both a presentation site and an application that facilitates the interaction between them, through actions like : creating an appointment, measure the distance fron the current location to the service. 

  The information system developed is a web application which has the objective of helping the clients of an auto service company to see, choose and obtain the needed services, making also the client management easier for the company side.
	This system is developed for the purpose of making real a relationship between the company and the client, which begins online, but could transform into a physical one. The cars’ issues are very various. If users don’t have knowledge of mechanics, buying a piece and replacing it by themselves is not a solution. Other times, even if one knows how to solve the problem, one doesn’t have the needed equipment to do so. The car services around the corner may not always be an option; maybe they are not trustable, they turn out to be too expensive, the mechanics are not well prepared, or the finish time cannot be estimated. One may be a comfortable or a shy person, or one may want to minimize the interaction with people in order to reduce the risk of COVID infection. Whatever the situation is, a man whose car is in trouble will chose a trustable company, like the one described by the application presented, and will need the functionalities provided.
	The purpose of this application is to improve the online management of the auto service and the user experience, by efficiently extending the company in the online aria. For performing that, a new application is needed, that provides both some of the basic existing functionalities, but reimplemented in a new manner, like: offering contact data, presenting the services, and a couple of new functionalities, essential ones, but not provided by the company’s current online system:
-	Create a client account (and logging in / out), which will be useful in improving implementing some other features;
-	Only the users who has created a client account can make an online appointment, using the dedicated section – in this way, the program can’t be tricked by some users with malicious intention, who can ask for fake appointments and unnecessarily allocate the time dedicated to the clients, wasting it. Not only that clients can now make their appointments by their own, but the whole process is now more secured. More than that, the process of manually making an appointment is very complicated, as the following diagram describes:

-	The clients (users who benefit of a client account) can has a more special relation with the company, in the sense that they can access a section dedicated to taking pictures, which will help mechanic easily identify the problem and offer better support, without the need of an appointment, in many cases.
-	A client can ask for urgent help, application providing the possibility of accessing the current location and sending it to the dedicated team, that can come and solve the issue, in the case of a car that stops suddenly while driving, for example.
